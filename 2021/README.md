# Advent of Code 21

Code for all the Advent of Code'21 challenges mostly written in python. They are not necessarily the best or fastest solutions but just the unmodified versions of what I wrote during the contest itself.

Some challenges have 2 files where continuation of the problem is significantly different

### Running python script
```bash
python3 ${filename}.py
```
### Running awk script
```bash
awk -f ${filename}.awk ${input}.txt
```
